# Block Breaker 

A single page which displays a game i've called Block Breaker. The game uses phaser.js to render the game on the website.

The current deployment of my game can be found here: https://adammcadam.github.io/phasergame/

## UX

This game and website is designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible. Hence why there is a single page to play the game on with a modal describing how to play to the user

## User Stories 

* As a user, I want to be able to just play the game and not care about anything else on the screen
* As a user, I want to be able to see my score whilst playing and the number of lives i have left.
* As a user, I want to be able to easily reset once I hit game over

#### [HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/) & [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)
- HTML5 & CSS3 were used to create the layout and styling of this site
- Code validators were used to check for errors with the [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

#### [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- Javascript and the selected external libraries have been used throughout this site.
- Mainly [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) for the game.

#### [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)

## Testing

The site has been thoroughly tested throughout development. The physics on the game itself is tested using phaser.js own debug menu.

The responsiveness and correct displaying of all elements has been tested on a number of devices, browsers, and resolutions. Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Edge, and IE all display without issue.

The following physical devices tested with no issues found.
- Windows desktop HD & UHD
- Google Pixel 2
- Apple iPad Pro
- Apple MacBook Air

## Deployment

The site was developed using the cloud9 IDE and uses git for version control which is then pushed to GitHub. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and deployed there from the master branch on GitHub. There is no difference between the development version of this site, and the final version hosted on GitHub Pages.

To deploy this project, I took the following initial steps:

From my GitHub page I clicked on 'Repositories' and selected the required repository, in this case 'phasergame'

I then clicked on the 'settings' option, located on the top horizontal menu bar

Next, I scrolled down the page to the GitHub Pages section and located the dropdown box under 'Source'

From there I selected the 'master branch'

GitHub takes you back to the top of the page to allow you to rename the repository if desired. I kept it the same.

These steps resulted in the finished site being deployed at https://adammcadam.github.io/phasergame/.

Every subsequent push to GitHub on the master branch updates the deployed site to match.
