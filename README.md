# Block Breaker 

A single page which displays a game i've called Block Breaker. The game uses phaser.js to render the game on the website.

The current deployment of my game can be found here: https://adammcadam.github.io/phasergame/

## UX

This game and website is designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible. Hence why there is a single page to play the game on with a modal describing how to play to the user

## User Stories 

* As a user, I want to be able to just play the game and not care about anything else on the screen
* As a user, I want to be able to see my score whilst playing and the number of lives i have left.
* As a user, I want to be able to easily reset once I hit game over
